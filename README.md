Advances in Mechatronics and Biomechanics towards Efficient Robot Actuation

Original Research articles report on primary and unpublished studies and should describe the aims and hypothesis, methods, results and interpretation of the research. Original Research articles may also encompass confirming studies, as well as disconfirming results which allow hypothesis elimination, reformulation and/or report on the non-reproducibility of previously published results. Articles should include the following sections:

- Introduction

- Materials and Methods
 
- Results

- Discussion

Original Research Articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may include up to 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research Article.
