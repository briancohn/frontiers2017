Advances in Mechatronics and Biomechanics towards Efficient Robot Actuation

Original Research articles report on primary and unpublished studies and should describe the aims and hypothesis, methods, results and interpretation of the research. Original Research articles may also encompass confirming studies, as well as disconfirming results which allow hypothesis elimination, reformulation and/or report on the non-reproducibility of previously published results. Articles should include the following sections:

- Introduction

- Materials and Methods
 
- Results

- Discussion

Original Research Articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may include up to 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research Article.


Article Title *
Please enter the full title of your manuscript.


Running Title *
Please enter a short running title for your manuscript. The maximum allowed character count is 100 characters (including spaces).

Abstract *
Please enter the abstract of your manuscript. The maximum allowed word count is 350 words. Please also note that the editor will only allow plain text.

Body Text *
Please enter the body text of your manuscript. The maximum allowed word count is 12000 words. Only plain text will be added, and special characters will be replaced by placeholders. Please note that this text is for editorial verification purposes and the manuscript files sent out to editors and reviewers will be uploaded in the next submission steps.

Keywords *
Keywords are an essential part of your paper's submission. Be sure to carefully choose your keywords so that your article can be found in databases by colleagues in your research area - if you don't choose the right specific keywords, your paper could be overlooked! Please provide at least 5 keywords.

Example of GOOD keywords:
5-HTTLPR, serotonin transporter gene, serotonin, neurotransmitter reuptake, mood, depression, mouse models

Examples of VAGUE keywords (bad!):
brain, genetics, cell biology, neuroscience,  psychology, physiology

Examples of TOO-LONG keywords (very bad!):
The interaction of genetics and environment in mood disorders, mouse models of depressive disorder, the effects of serotonin transporter gene variants on behavior
