Advances in Mechatronics and Biomechanics towards Efficient Robot Actuation

Original Research articles report on primary and unpublished studies and should describe the aims and hypothesis, methods, results and interpretation of the research. Original Research articles may also encompass confirming studies, as well as disconfirming results which allow hypothesis elimination, reformulation and/or report on the non-reproducibility of previously published results. Articles should include the following sections:

- Introduction

- Materials and Methods
 
- Results

- Discussion

Original Research Articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may include up to 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research Article.

#title: Motor learnability across posture


# Motor learnability across posture

Brian, Kian, Francisco

Learning algorithms applied to tendon-driven limbs are not rigorously tested on robotic or cadaveric tissues in a way that systematically permutes posture and noise. Furthermore, the amount of data required to measure the mechanical component of neuromotor noise is unclear. There exists a gap between the mechanical properties of cadaveric tendon-driven limbs across realistic positions, and the models that describe how tendon forces affect the limb's endpoint force behavior. We addressed this limitation by inventing a tension-to-force experiment that collects data across hundreds of isometric endpoint postures of any tendon-driven limb controlled by up to 10 newtons per tendon. We experimented with a bioinspired robotic finger as a stand-in for a cadaveric finger, attached a six-dimensional force sensor at its fingertip, we wound tension-controlled strings about its joints in an arbitrary routing. The fingertip fit snugly in the force sensor, which was affixed to a manipulator---that way, we were able to move the posture with sub millimeter precision, in under 2 seconds. Using the resultant data (with 1000 postures and 100 tensions across 7-tendons) we (i) characterized static and dynamic components of the tension-to-force relationship, (ii) identified specific postures t hat are more challenging to control accurately, (iii) compared the performance of models from the literature (linear, dynamic, and linear-cascade), (iv) and evaluated the robustness of results under differing sample size & noise. Our contribution empowers artificial intelligence experts to develop robust interpretations of a model's performance atop data from the entire postural workspace, thereby enabling biologically-inspired tactile sensing from the muscle properties themselves. In capturing the variables associated with posture-specific tendon-driven control, we open a new front for thorough understanding of the biomechanical constraints and pressures across in learning, health, disease, and in an evolutionary context.
